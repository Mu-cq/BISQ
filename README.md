# BISQ
VTI BISQ poroelastic wave equation \
This is a Matlab code package to solve BISQ poroelastic wave equation based on Parra, J. O. (1997).\
Perfectly matched layers (PML) and absorbing boundary condition (ABC) are applied. \
Please download all of the files and run 'poro_template.m' for simulation.\
